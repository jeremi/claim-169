# Reusable workflow for building Python wheels across all platforms
#
# Builds wheels for:
# - Linux x86_64
# - macOS x86_64 and arm64
# - Windows x86_64
#
# Also builds source distribution (sdist)
#
# Note: Linux aarch64 cross-compilation requires additional setup and is not
# currently included. Users on Linux ARM can build from source using the sdist.
